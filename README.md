# Waste Water Monitoring System

This is a web dashboard that displays various parameters of waste water quality, such as turbidity, total dissolved solids, pH, and temperature. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface. It also uses ApexCharts to render area charts for each parameter.

### Prerequisites

Install the following prerequisites:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the **Live Server** extension.

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) allows us to launch a local development server that enables a live reload of our project.

### Documentation

The project uses the following libraries and frameworks:

- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com): A JavaScript charting library that allows you to create interactive and responsive charts.
- Material Icons: A set of icons that follow the Material Design guidelines.

The project structure is as follows:

- index.html: The main HTML file that contains the dashboard layout and content.
- css/styles.css: The main CSS file that defines the styles and responsiveness of the dashboard.
- js/scripts.js: The main JavaScript file that handles the chart rendering and interactivity of the dashboard.

### Run the application

To run the application, start the **Live Server** by clicking **Go Live** in the bottom right corner of the status bar in Visual Studio Code. This action will load the web page in your default web browser.

### View the application

Once the **Live Server** is up and running, go to http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html to view the web page.
